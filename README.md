address-validator
======================

> Validate street addresses in nodejs using google geocoding api.

From an input address the lib will return to you a valid address with correct spelling and lat/lon coords, and/or a set of inexact matches that can be used to drive a 'did you mean?' widget.

Currently geared towards North American Addresses but works with all languages.

Install
-------

``` bash
npm install address-validator
```

![npm](https://nodei.co/npm/address-validator.png)

Usage
-----

``` js
var addressValidator = require('address-validator');
var Address = addressValidator.Address;
var _ = require('underscore');

//any of the props in this object are optional, also spelling does not have to be exact.
var address = new Address({
    street: '100 North Washington St',
    city: 'Bostont',
    state: 'Mass',
    country: 'US'
});

//the passed in address does not need to be an address object it can be a string. (address objects will give you a better likelihood of finding an exact match)
address = '100 North Washington St, Boston, MA, US';

//`addressValidator.match.streetAddress` -> tells the validator that you think the input should be a street address. This data makes the validator more accurate.
// But, sometimes you dont know.. in that cause you should use `addressValidator.match.unknown`
addressValidator.validate(address, addressValidator.match.streetAddress, function(err, exact, inexact){
    console.log('input: ', address.toString())
    console.log('match: ', _.map(exact, function(a) {
      return a.toString();
    }));
    console.log('did you mean: ', _.map(inexact, function(a) {
      return a.toString();
    }));

    //access some props on the exact match
    var first = exact[0];
    console.log(first.streetNumber + ' '+ first.street);
});

```

Some example inputs/outputs from above:

``` bash
input:  12 proctor rd, Massachussetts, US
exact:  []
did you mean:  [ '12 Proctor Road, Chelmsford, MA, US',
  '12 Proctor Road, Townsend, MA, US',
  '12 Proctor Road, Braintree, MA, US',
  '12 Proctor Road, Everett, MA, US',
  '12 Proctor Road, Falmouth, MA, US' ]


input:  100 North Washington St, Boston, MA, US
exact:  [ '100 North Washington Street, Boston, MA, US' ]
did you mean:  []


input:  1 Main St, San Diego, US
address:  []
did you mean:  [ '1 Main Street, San Diego, CA, US' ]

```

API
=======

`addressValidator = require('address-validator');`

addressValidator.validate(inputAddr, [addressType, ] cb)
-------------------------

validate an input address.

    `inputAddr` - validator.Address object or map with 'street', 'city', 'state', 'country' keys, or string address
    `addressType` - validator.match.[key] where key is: streetAddress, route, city, state, country, unknown
            This tells the validator the type of an address you are expecting to validate. default is `validator.match.streetAddress` (you may omit this arg).
    `cb`: `function(err, validAddresses, inexactMatches, geocodingResponse)`
        `err` - something went wrong calling the google api
        `validAddresses` - list of Address objects. These are exact matches to your input, and will have proper spelling, caps etc. Its best that you use this instead of what you had
        `inexactMatches` - list of Address objects. Incomplete addresses or addresses that do not match your input address. useful for 'did you mean?' type UIs
        `geocodingResponse` - the json object that i got from google API

addressValidator.setOptions(options)
-------------------------

set address lookup options

    `options`: an object containing:
        `countryBias`: more likely to find addresses in this country. Think of this as you where you are searching "from" to find results around you. (use ISO 3166-1 country code)
        `countryMatch`: match results in this country only. (ISO 3166-1 country code)
        `key`: optional google api key (if used will submit requests over https)
        `language`: optional locale to translate the results into, 'DE' for German, etc.

addressValidator.Address class
------------------------

    Address object that provides useful methods. Create a new one by
      1. passing a map with these props: {street:'123 main st', city: 'boston', state: 'MA'|'massachussetts', country: 'US'|'United States'}
        None of the props are required, but chances are you wont have a valid address if you omit any of them (except for state)
      2. passing a string containing an address (the address class does not parse the string into parts)
      3. passing a result object from a google geocoding response. ie: geoResponse.results[0]


    The validator.validate callback will return to you these objects, except they will have all or some of the following properties:
        streetNumber: '100'
        street: 'North Main St'
        streetAbbr: 'N Main St'
        city: 'Boston'
        state: 'Massachussetts'
        stateAbbr: 'MA'
        country: 'United States'
        countryAbbr: 'US'
        postalCode: 02114
        colloquialArea: '' // e.g. 'Silicon Valley'
        sublocality: '' // e.g. 'Brooklyn'
        location: {lat: 43.233332, lon: 23.2222243}

    Methods:
        `toString(useCountryAbbr, useStateAbbr, useStreetAbbr)` - returns a string representing the address. currently geared towards North American addresses
            useCountryAbbr = [optional] default: true - the resulting address string should use country abbr, not the full country name
            useStateAbbr   = [optional] default: true - the resulting address string should use state abbr, not the full state name
            useStreetAbbr  = [optional] default: false - the resulting address string should use street name abbr, not the full street name
            Note: the abbriviated values will only be used if they are available. The Address objects returned to you from the validate callback may have these available.
